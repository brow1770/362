# 362
Fall 2021 ECE 362 Project

The C code in this repository was used to program an STM32F091RCTx microcontroller for function as a real time clock with a programmable alarm system.
There is source code (src) to interface the Adafruit Ultimate GPS breakout board which we used as a time base for our clock, a TFT LCD display which displays
the time in analag form, a MIDI interpreter which plays MIDI files when the alarm sounds, an OLED display for digital and alarm programming, and finally
a keypad for programming the alarm. All work was completed by Ben Brown, Henry Wong, Philip Yao, and Nikki Kozel for ECE 362 at Purdue University.
